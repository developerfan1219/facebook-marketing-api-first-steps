# Facebook Marketing API First Steps
I couldn't find a simple repository with practical examples for Facebook Marketing APIs beginners, so I created it for us. Here you'll find some code examples for accessing, creating and editing Campaigns, Ad Sets and Ads in your Facebook Business Manager and Ad Account.

## Important! Read before start
Please be aware that some of the codes edit your existing Ad Account settings and a mistake could generate unwanted expenses.

## How to start
The first thing you need to do is copy the file **my_facebook_access_example-model.py** to your Desktop, remove the **_example-model** by renaming it to **my_facebook_access.py**, and add your Facebook private informations (App Id, App Secret, Access Token, Business Ad and the Campaign Ids you want to work with).

After doing that, you're ready to start using some of the codes on this repository.
